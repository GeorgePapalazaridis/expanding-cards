# Expanding Cards

Expanding Cards is a simple yet elegant HTML/CSS/JavaScript project that demonstrates DOM manipulation and CSS animations to create an interactive user experience. 

## Features

- Expanding and collapsing panels with smooth transitions
- Flexbox layout for responsiveness
- CSS animations for text appearance
- Lightweight and reusable design

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (with media queries for responsiveness)
- JavaScript (event listeners and class manipulation)

## How It Works

Each panel expands when clicked, using JavaScript to dynamically add or remove the `active` class. CSS handles smooth transitions for the expansion and text appearance.
